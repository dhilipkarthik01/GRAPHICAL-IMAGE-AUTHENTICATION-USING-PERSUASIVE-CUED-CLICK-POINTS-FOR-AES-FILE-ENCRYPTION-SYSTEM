# GRAPHICAL-IMAGE-AUTHENTICATION-USING-PERSUASIVE-CUED-CLICK-POINTS-FOR-AES-FILE-ENCRYPTION-SYSTEM

## About the Project:
Passwords play a huge role in keeping your data safe online as well as offline platforms. There are various types of authentication available for users to secure their accounts. In a graphical password authentication system, the user has to select from images, in a specific order, presented to them in a graphical user interface (GUI). 
The Persuasive Technology guides and encourages the user to select stronger passwords (i.e. Click-points). In this project, the graphical authentication system allows the user click on any one part of image out of the 4 available parts of the image.
